# DesktopVRSwitch
Allows you to switch between Desktop and VR with a keybind.

Press Control + F6 to switch. SteamVR will automatically start if it isn't already running.

---

Almost all base game features & systems that differ when in VR are now updated after switch. There are still very likely small quirks that need ironing out still, but everything major is now fixed and accounted for. 

This mod will likely cause issues with other mods that are not built for or expect VRMode changes during runtime.

## There are two versions of this mod!
**DesktopVRSwitch** is built for the Stable branch of ChilloutVR. (OpenVR)

**DesktopXRSwitch** is built for the Experimental branch of ChilloutVR (OpenXR)

Once the Experimental branch of ChilloutVR hits Stable, the mod name will be changing from VR -> XR.
